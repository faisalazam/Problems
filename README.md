## Tree Traversal Techniques

Unlike linear data structures (Array, Linked List, Queues, Stacks, etc) which have only one logical way to traverse them, trees can be traversed in different ways.

A Tree Data Structure can be traversed in following ways:

* Depth First Search or DFS
  * Inorder Traversal
  * Preorder Traversal
  * Postorder Traversal
* Level Order Traversal or Breadth First Search or BFS
* Boundary Traversal
* Diagonal Traversal

### Uses of Inorder Traversal:

In the case of binary search trees (BST), Inorder traversal gives nodes in non-decreasing order. To get nodes of BST 
in non-increasing order, a variation of Inorder traversal where Inorder traversal is reversed can be used.

### Uses of Preorder:

Preorder traversal is used to create a copy of the tree. Preorder traversal is also used to get prefix expressions on 
an expression tree.

### Uses of Postorder:

Postorder traversal is used to delete the tree. Postorder traversal is also useful to get the postfix expression of 
an expression tree.
