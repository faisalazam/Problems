     * Given a char array representing tasks CPU need to do.
     * It contains capital letters A to Z where different letters represent different tasks.
     * Tasks could be done without original order. Each task could be done in one interval.
     * For each interval, CPU could finish one task or just be idle.
     *
     * However, there is a non-negative cooling interval n that means between two same tasks,
     * there must be at least n intervals that CPU are doing different tasks or just be idle.
     *
     * You need to return the least number of intervals the CPU will take to finish all the given tasks.
