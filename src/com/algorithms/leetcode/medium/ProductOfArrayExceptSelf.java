/**
 * Given an integer array nums, return an array answer such that answer[i] is equal to the product of all the elements
 * of nums except nums[i].
 * <p>
 * The product of any prefix or suffix of nums is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit integer.
 * <p>
 * You must write an algorithm that runs in O(n) time and without using the division operation.
 * <p>
 * Note: Please solve it without division and in O(n). (because, if we are allowed to divide, then we can calculate the
 * product of whole array in one pass, and then divide the whole product with nums[i] to get the product except self...)
 * <p>
 * Follow up: Could you solve it with constant space complexity?
 * (The output array does not count as extra space for the purpose of space complexity analysis.)
