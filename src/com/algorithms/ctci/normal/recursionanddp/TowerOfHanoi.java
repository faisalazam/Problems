/**
 * Towers of Hanoi: In the classic problem of the Towers of Hanoi, you have 3 towers
 * and N disks of different sizes which can slide onto any tower.
 * The puzzle starts with disks sorted in ascending order of size from top to bottom
 * (i.e., each disk sits on top of an even larger one). You have the following constraints:
 * (1) Only one disk can be moved at a time.
 * (2) A disk is slid off the top of one tower onto another tower.
 * (3) A disk cannot be placed on top of a smaller disk.
 * <p>
 * Write a program to move the disks from the first tower to the last using Stacks.

     * 1. We simply move Disk 1 from Tower 1 to Tower 3.
     * Case n = 2. Can we move Disk 1 and Disk 2from Tower Ho Tower 3?Yes.
     * 1. Move Disk 1 from Tower 1 to Tower 2
     * 2. Move Disk 2 from Tower 1 to Tower 3
     * 3. Move Disk 1 from Tower 2 to Tower 3
     * Note how in the above steps, Tower 2 acts as a buffer, holding a disk while we move other disks to Tower 3.
     * Case n = 3. Can we move Disk 1, 2, and 3 from Tower 1 to Tower 3? Yes.
     * 1, We know we can move the top two disks from one tower to another (as shown earlier),
     * so let's assume we've already done that. But instead, let's move them to Tower 2.
     * 2, Move Disk 3 to Tower 3.
     * 3, Move Disk 1 and Disk 2 to Tower 3.
     * We already know how to do thisâ€”just repeat what we did in Step 1,
     * Case n = 4. Can we move Disk 1, 2, 3 and 4 from Tower 1 to Tower 3? Yes.
     * 1. Move Disks 1, 2, and 3 to Tower 2. We know how to do that from the earlier examples.
     * 2. Move Disk 4 to Tower 3.
     * 3. Move Disks 1, 2 and 3 back to Tower 3
     * <p>
     * Remember that the labels of Tower 2 and Tower 3 aren't important.
     * They're equivalent towers. So, moving disks to Tower 3 with Tower 2 serving as a buffer is equivalent to
     * moving disks to Tower 2 with Tower 3 serving as a buffer.
