     * Peaks and Valleys: In an array of integers, a "peak" is an element which is greater than or equal to the
     * adjacent integers and a "valley" is an element which is less than or equal to the adjacent integers.
     * For example, in the array (5, 8, 6, 2, 3, 4, 6}, (8,6} are peaks and {5, 2} are valleys.
     * Given an array of integers, sort the array into an alternating sequence of peaks and valleys.
     * <p>
     * Suboptimal Solution
     * Since this problem asks us to sort the array in a particular way, one thing we can try is doing a normal sort
     * and then "fixing" the array into an alternating sequence of peaks and valleys.
     * <p>
     * Before coding, we should clarify the exact algorithm, though.
     * 1. Sort the array in ascending order.
     * 2. Iterate through the elements, starting from index 1 (not 0) and jumping two elements at a time.
     * 3. At each element, swap it with the previous element. Since every three elements appear in the order
     * small <= medium <= large , swapping these elements will always put medium as a peak: medium <= small <= large.
     * This approach will ensure that the peaks are in the right place: indexes 1, 3, 5, and so on.
     * As long as the odd- numbered elements (the peaks) are bigger than the adjacent elements,
     * then the even-numbered elements (the valleys) must be smaller than the adjacent elements.
     * <p>
     * This algorithm runs in 0(n log n) time.
     * <p>
     * This problem is also known as the Sort an array in wave form

     * greater than their adjacent odd elements, we donâ€™t need to worry about oddly positioned elements.

     * Traverse all even positioned elements of the input array, and do the following.
     * If the current element is smaller than the previous odd element, swap the previous and current.
     * If the current element is smaller than the next odd element, swap next and current.
