/**
 * Loop Detection: Given a circular linked list, implement an algorithm that returns the node at the beginning of the
 * loop.
 * <p>
 * DEFINITION
 * Circular linked list: A (corrupt) linked list in which a node's next pointer points to an earlier node,
 * to make a loop in the linked list.
 * <p>
 * SOLUTION
 * Part 1: Detect If Linked List Has A Loop
 * An easy way to detect if a linked list has a loop is through the FastRunner / SlowRunner approach.
 * Fast Runner moves two steps at a time, while SlowRunner moves one step.
 * <p>
 * Part 2: When Do They Collide?
 * Since k might be much larger than the loop length, we should actually write this as mod ( k , LOOP_SIZE) steps,
 * which we will denote as K.
 * So, when do they meet? Well, if FastRunner is L00P_SIZE - K steps behind SlowRunner,
 * and FastRunner catches up at a rate of 1 step per unit of time, then they meet after LOOP_SIZE - K steps.
 * At this point, they will be K steps before the head of the loop. Let's call this point CollisionSpot.
 * <p>
 * Part 3: How Do You Find The Start of the Loop?
 * We now know that CollisionSpot is K nodes before the start of the loop. Because K = mod(k, LOOP_ SIZE)
 * (or, in other words, k = K + M * LOOP_SIZE, for any integer M), it is also correct to say that
 * it is k nodes from the loop start. For example, if node N is 2 nodes into a 5 node loop,
 * it is also correct to say that it is 7,12, or even 397 nodes into the loop.
 * Therefore, both CollisionSpot and Linked List Head are k nodes from the start of the loop.
 * Now, if we keep one pointer at CollisionSpot and move the other one to Linked List Head, they will each be k nodes
 * from LoopStart. Moving the two pointers at the same speed will cause them to collide again
 * this time after k steps, at which point they will both be at LoopStart. All we have to do is return this node.

        // same pace, they must meet at Loop Start.
        // After detecting the loop, if we start the slow pointer from the head and move both slow and fast pointers at
        // the same speed until fast donâ€™t meet, they would meet at the beginning of the loop.

        // n --> Length of the loop cycle
        // m --> Distance of first node of the loop cycle from the head of the list
        // k --> Distance of point where slow and fast pointers meet
        //
        // Distance traveled by fast pointer = 2 * (Distance traveled by slow pointer)
        //                     (m + n*x + k) = 2*(m + n*y + k)
        //
        // Note that before meeting the point shown above, fast was moving at twice speed.
        //
        // x --> Number of complete cyclic rounds made by fast pointer before they meet first time
        // y --> Number of complete cyclic rounds made by slow pointer before they meet first time
        // From the above equation, we can conclude below
        //
        //    (m + n*x + k) = 2*(m + n*y + k) = 2m + 2n*y + 2k
        //    n*x = 2m + 2n*y + 2k - k - m = m + 2n*y + k
        //    m + k = n*x - 2n*y = (x-2y)*n
        //
        // Which means m+k is a multiple of n.
        //
        // So if we start moving both pointers again at the same speed such that one pointer (say slow) begins from the
        // head node of the linked list and other pointers (say fast) begins from the meeting point. When the slow
        // pointer reaches the beginning of the loop (has made m steps), the fast pointer would have made also moved
        // m steps as they are now moving the same pace. Since m+k is a multiple of n and fast starts from k, they
        // would meet at the beginning. Can they meet before also? No, because the slow pointer enters the cycle first
        // time after m steps.
