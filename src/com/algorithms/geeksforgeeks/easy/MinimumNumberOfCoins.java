     * Solution: Greedy Approach.
     * The intuition would be to take coins with greater value first. This can reduce the total number of coins needed.
     * Start from the largest possible denomination and keep adding denominations while the remaining value is greater
     * than 0.
     * <p>
     * Approach: A common intuition would be to take coins with greater value first. This can reduce the total number
     * of coins needed. Start from the largest possible denomination and keep adding denominations while the remaining
     * value is greater than 0.
     * <p>
     * Time Complexity: O(V). where V is the total amount that we are trying to make with the available coins.
     * Auxiliary Space: O(1).
     * <p>
     * Note: The above approach may not work for all denominations.
     * <p>
     * For example, it doesnâ€™t work for denominations {9, 6, 5, 1} and V = 11. The above approach would print
     * 9, 1 and 1. But we can use 2 denominations 5 and 6. The following link has solution for this problem.
