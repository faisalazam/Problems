     * Given a linked list of N nodes. The task is to check if the the linked list has a loop.
     * Linked list can contain self loop.
     * <p>
     * User Task:
     * The task is to complete the function detectloop() which contains reference to the head as only argument.
     * This function should return 1 if linked list contains loop, else return 0.
     * <p>
     * Challenge : Try to solve the problem with constant space and Linear time complexity.

     * By using Floydâ€™s Cycle-Finding Algorithm: This algorithm is used to find a loop in a linked list. It uses two
     * pointers one moving twice as fast as the other one. The faster one is called the faster pointer and the other
     * one is called the slow pointer, if both pointers meet then the cycle is present otherwise not.
     * <p>
     * Time Complexity: O(N)
     * Auxiliary Space: O(1)
