     * Insertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm that works similar to the way you sort playing cards in your hands.
     * The array is virtually split into a sorted and an unsorted part. Values from the unsorted part are picked and
     * placed at the correct position in the sorted part.
     * <p>
     * The task is to complete insert() function which is used to implement Insertion Sort.
     * <p>
     * https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/insertion-sort/1
     * <p>
     * Time Complexity: O(NÂ²) Two loops are required for the comparison and sorting.
     * Auxiliary Space: O(1) Since No extra Array or space is used.
