/**
 * Quick Sort is a Divide and Conquer algorithm. It picks an element as a pivot and partitions the given array
 * around the picked pivot. Given an array arr[], its starting position is low (the index of the array) and its
 * ending position is high(the index of the array).
 * <p>
 * Note: The low and high are inclusive.
 * <p>
 * Implement the partition() and quickSort() functions to sort the array.
 * <p>
 * Your Task:
 * You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the functions partition() and
 * quickSort() which takes the array arr[], low and high as input parameters and partitions the array. Consider
 * the last element as the pivot such that all the elements less than(or equal to) the pivot lie before it and the
 * elements greater than it lie after the pivot.
 * <p>
 * QuickSort is a Divide and Conquer algorithm.
 * <p>
 * It picks an element as a pivot and partitions the given array around the picked pivot. There are many different
 * versions of quickSort that pick pivots in different ways.
 * <p>
 * Always pick the first element as a pivot.
 * Always pick the last element as a pivot (we are using this in this editorial).
 * Pick a random element as a pivot.
 * Pick the median as the pivot.
 * <p>
 * The key process in quickSort is a partition(). The target of partitions is, given an array and an element x of an
 * array as the pivot, put x at its correct position in a sorted array and put all smaller elements (smaller than x)
 * before x, and put all greater elements (greater than x) after x. All this should be done in linear time.
 * <p>
 * Advantages of Quick Sort:
 * <p>
 * It is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that makes it easier to solve problems.
 * It is efficient on large data sets.
 * It has a low overhead, as it only requires a small amount of memory to function.
 * <p>
 * Disadvantages of Quick Sort:
 * <p>
 * It has a worst-case time complexity of O(N2), which occurs when the pivot is chosen poorly.
 * It is not a good choice for small data sets.
 * It is not a stable sort, meaning that if two elements have the same key, their relative order will not be preserved
 * in the sorted output in case of quick sort, because here we are swapping elements according to the pivotâ€™s position
 * (without considering their original positions).
 * <p>
 * Time Complexity:
 * Worst Case: O(N2), The worst case occurs when the partition process always picks the greatest or smallest element
 * as the pivot. If we consider the above partition strategy where the last element is always picked as a pivot, the
 * worst case would occur when the array is already sorted in increasing or decreasing order
 * Best Case: O(NlogN), The best case occurs when the partition process always picks the middle element as the pivot.
 * where N is the size of the array for placing the pivot element it takes N and the total number of partitions is
 * approx logN in the best case so the overall complexity is O(NlogN)
 * Average Case: O(NlogN)
 * Space Complexity: O(logN), Recursion stack takes logN space and in the worst case quicksort could make O(N)..
