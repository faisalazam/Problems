/**
 * Given a Directed Graph. Find any Topological Sorting of that Graph.
 * <p>
 * Graph doesn't contain multiple edges, self loops and cycles. Graph may be disconnected.
 * <p>
 * Expected Time Complexity: O(V + E).
 * Expected Auxiliary Space: O(V).

 * <p>
 * Topological sorting for Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) is a linear ordering of vertices such that for every directed
 * edge u v, vertex u comes before v in the ordering.
 * <p>
 * There can be more than one topological sorting for a graph. The first vertex in topological sorting is always a
 * vertex with an in-degree of 0 (a vertex with no incoming edges).
 * <p>
 * Topological Sorting for a graph is not possible if the graph is not a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG).
 * <p>
 * Applications of Topological Sorting:
 * <p>
 * Topological Sorting is mainly used for scheduling jobs from the given dependencies among jobs.
 * In computer science, applications of this type arise in:
 * Instruction scheduling
 * Ordering of formula cell evaluation when recomputing formula values in spreadsheets
 * Logic synthesis
 * Determining the order of compilation tasks to perform in make files
 * Data serialization
 * Resolving symbol dependencies in linkers

     * Kahn's Algorithm - BFS
     * <p>
     * The main idea is to deal with indegree as we know in topological sort vertex with less indegree comes first
     * which means indegree with zero is the first element in topo sort, so we can apply the below idea to get topo sort:
     * <p>
     * 1) We will print the node which has indegree 0(They have no dependency) first.
     * 2) Then remove their adjacent edges and update the indegree of adjacent nodes which are connected with previous
     * nodes with indegree zero.
     * 3) Repeat Steps 1 and 2 until we have a node with indegree 0.
     * <p>
     * Why there always be a node with indegree 0?
     * As we are working with D.A.G So there must have always a starting point of a graph and that have indegree=0
     * <p>
     * Time Complexity: O(V+E): As we are traversing over all vertex of every edge using BFS so total time will be O(V+E).
     * Auxiliary space: O(V). Extra space is needed for the queue, indegree, and answer array.

     * DFS
     * <p>
     * We can modify DFS to find the Topological Sorting of a graph. In DFS,
     * <p>
     * We start from a vertex, we first print it, and then
     * Recursively call DFS for its adjacent vertices.
     * In topological sorting,
     * <p>
     * We use a temporary stack.
     * We donâ€™t print the vertex immediately,
     * we first recursively call topological sorting for all its adjacent vertices, then push it to a stack.
     * <p>
     * Finally, print the contents of the stack.
     * Note: A vertex is pushed to stack only when all of its adjacent vertices (and their adjacent vertices and so on)
     * are already in the stack
     * <p>
     * If we will print nodes in descending order of their finishing time of dfs that will be a topo sort. We will print
     * the node v only after it goes through to all its descendants. This ensures that anything that follows v will have
     * been added to the output vector before v.
     * <p>
     * Time Complexity: O(V+E). As we are traversing over all vertex of every edge using DFS so total time will be
     * O(V+E). It is simply DFS with an extra stack. So time complexity is the same as DFS.
     * Auxiliary space: O(V). Extra space is needed for the stack and visited array.
